This is a simple Snake game written in Python, where the user can control the snake with the arrow keys. The game saves the high score as a file on the user's computer and displays it on the screen during the game, and it is automatically updated.

## How to Play:
- Download or clone the repository to your computer
- Run `python main.py` to start the game
- Use the arrow keys to move the snake
- The objective is to eat as much food as possible without colliding with the wall or the snake's own body
- The game ends when the snake collides with the wall or its own body
- The high score is saved as a file on the user's computer and displayed on the screen during the game.
